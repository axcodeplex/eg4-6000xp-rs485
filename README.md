# eg4-6000xp-rs485
Documentation of configuring and connecting the 6000XP directly to SolarAssistant via RS485

There seem to be a few paths here;
*Using a RS485/USB/RJ45 straight from the RPI/SA to the CT1 port on the inverter
*Using the hard-wire posts in the bottom left of the control panel in the inverter
*Snagging the RS485 A/B connection from an HDMI breakout connector
*Snagging the RS485 A/B connections from the board directly where the HDMI plug board hooks to the inverters main board
